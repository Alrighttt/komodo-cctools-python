This program was created for demonstration and partial automation of Komodo GatewaysCC stack testing. (AssetsCC, OraclesCC, GatewaysCC, oraclesfeed dAPP)

Python3 required for execution: sudo apt-get install python3.6

Before execution be sure than daemon for needed AC up.

At the moment raw version of manual gateway how-to guide can be found here: http://pad.supernet.org/cc_gateways_guide I advice to read it before you start use this tool to understand the flow.
